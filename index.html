    <h2>Summary</h2>
    With over a decade of experience within academic research projects, R&D departments and as a qualified industrial engineer I have a proven record of project management, data analysis and process improvement. At Britannia Pharmaceuticals, I rapidly devised a much-needed cost saving clinical supply tool for sharing information across European sites. Within EPAD I have driven study set-ups and created a process to share samples internationally. Finally, I am an expert in analysing large and complex data, producing dynamic visuals which highlight unambiguous critical information accurately and at a glance.
I am looking for an opportunity to employ my skills and experience to support delivery of significant outcomes and benefits.
